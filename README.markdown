#TestPlugin for pluginLoader
This is a repository to show how a simple plugin is made for my [PluginLoader](https://github.com/hugo4715/PluginLoader/).

To make a plugin, you must make a class that extends the Plugin class, and indicate it in the manifest file as the entrypoint.
All information on the plugins (name,version, author, entryPoint, description, website) are located in it's manifest file.
